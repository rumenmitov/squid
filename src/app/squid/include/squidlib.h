 squid.h provides an API to snapshot data to the disk.
 It is organized as a Radix Tree with an Upper Directory, Middle Directory, and
 a Lower Directory.

 Upper      - determined by the first two chars of the hash.
 Middle     - determined by the next pair of chars of the hash.
 Lower      - determined by the third pair of chars of the hash.
 Squid File - determined by remaining chars in hash.
